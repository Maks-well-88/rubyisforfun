# Ruby Is For Fun

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1477672/151709731-bb271f46-953e-4e09-bf8a-2b97eaf1bf5f.png)

I wrote this book for my son. He is only 8, and hopefully he'll enjoy it soon.

It was for sale, but now it's free and under CC license. I decided to share the knowledge, and make the book even better with your help (see how to contribute below).

I tried to make things super easy to understand, at the same time emphasize important concepts (like memory pointers, and working with objects). Please enjoy and share :)

# How to Contribute

Found typo, grammar error, or area of improvement? Contribute to this repo. I'll regenerate the PDF within 24-48 hours, and will update the LeanPub and PDF link in this readme.

Try to make your PRs as small as possible. It's okay to consolidate multiple tiny improvements into one PR. I will accept your changes asap.

If you can do a full-page design art-work (like the book cover), let me know at `roman.pushkin at gmail`. It would be nice to add 5-10 full-page images.
