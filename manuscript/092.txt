Knowledge represented in this book is the process of filtering out tons of information. You definitely have the competitive advantage over folks who haven't read the book yet. Don't worry if you missed some concepts, keep on learning and re-read the book in a few months, so you will uncover what's been hidden from your eyes. Information often comes in layers, and every time your picture becomes more clear and precise.
