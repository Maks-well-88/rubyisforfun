## include? method

"`include?`" method performs existence check over array and returns _Boolean_ value. For example:

```ruby
$ pry
> [1, 2, 3, 5, 8].include?(3)
true
```

Interesting detail is that some folks from Ruby community always wanted to rename this method to "`includes?`", but it didn't happen. So you have to remember that it comes without "s". In JavaScript ES6 existence check uses the "correct" spelling:

```javascript
$ node
> [1, 2, 3, 5, 8].includes(3);
true
```
