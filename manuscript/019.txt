## Strings Addition and Multiplication

Let's look at the program from previous chapter. Can we do better?

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=on}
```ruby
puts "Your age?"
age = gets
puts "Your age is"
puts age
```

We can replace line 3 and 4 with a single line. For example:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=on}
```ruby
puts "Your age?"
age = gets
puts "Your age is" + age
```

Result:

```
Your age?
30
Your age is30
```

Something is missing, isn't it? That's right, the space is missing between words "is" and "30". As you can see from example above, we can join two strings. From a purely math point of view adding up two strings is nonsense, but strings do concatenate (join) in computer memory. Run the following code in REPL or as a program:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=off}
```ruby
"My name is " + "Roman" + " and my age is " + "30"
```

Result:

```
My name is Roman and my age is 30
```

Now try to add these two numbers, both represented as a string, try to guess what would be the answer?

```
"100" + "500"
```

Spoiler: answer is "100500". In other words, if number is represented as a string (comes in quotes), Ruby will treat this number as a string. But if we just type  `100 + 500`  (without quotes), produced result will be `600`.

It turns out that you can also multiply string by a number:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=off}
```ruby
"10" * 5
 => "1010101010"
```

Result is `"10"` repeated 5 times. If we leave space after 10, result will be represented in a more illustrative way:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=off}
```ruby
"10 " * 5
 => "10 10 10 10 10 "
```

As it was mentioned before, `"10 "` is just a string, and we can use any string we want:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=off}
```ruby
"I'm cool! " * 10
 => "I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! I'm cool! "
```

But in practice, we sometimes multiply by 80 (legacy text screen width). We can multiply strings like `"*"`, `"="`, or `"-"` by 80 to logically separate our screen output. For example:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=off}
```ruby
puts "Your age?"
age = gets
puts "=" * 80
puts "Your age is " + age
```

Result:

```
Your age?
30
==================================================
Your age is 30
```
