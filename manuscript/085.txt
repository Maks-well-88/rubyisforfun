## Debugging by using console debugger

We're already familiar with Pry, which is another REPL (read-execute-print-loop). Pry implements more features rather than IRB (Interactive Ruby, standard REPL). With a little bit of extra effort Pry can be used as a console debugger. We'll look into basics of debugging with Pry. Knowing how to use this tool will save you a lot of time.

If for some reason Pry is not installed on your system yet (you can check it with "`which pry`"), type simple installation command:

```shell
$ gem install pry pry-doc
```  

This command installs two gems: "pry" and "pry-doc". Last one is a plugin for "pry" (normally plugin names for Pry start with "pry-" prefix) and contains documentation about native Ruby methods.

You can type Pry commands once Pry is executed with just typing "`pry`" in your terminal:

```shell
$ pry
> help

Help
  help               Show a list of commands or information about a specific command.

Context
  cd                 Move into a new context (object or scope).
  find-method        Recursively search for a method within a class/module or the current namespace.
  ls                 Show the list of vars and methods in the current scope.
  pry-backtrace      Show the backtrace for the pry session.
  raise-up           Raise an exception out of the current pry instance.
  reset              Reset the repl to a clean state.
  watch              Watch the value of an expression and print a notification whenever it changes.
  whereami           Show code surrounding the current context.
  wtf?               Show the backtrace of the most recent exception.

(and so on...)
```

You can get help for any command from the list above by adding "`-h`", for example:

```
[1] pry(main)> whereami -h
Usage: whereami [-qn] [LINES]

Describe the current location. If you use `binding.pry` inside a method then
whereami will print out the source for that method.
...
```

Look at the Ruby program that is supposed to raise a number to the second power, so for 2 result is 4, for 3 result is 9, for 4 is 16, and so on (this operation equals to multiplying number by self one time):

```ruby
def random_pow
  pow(rand(1..10))
end

def pow(x)
  x ^ 2
end

puts random_pow
```

Can you spot anything wrong above? Looks pretty legit: it generates random number and raises the number to the second power. However, it is weird. Give it a try. For example, it prints 6 when it shouldn't. Program can print only 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.

The program was made intentionally with the bug. Can you spot it? It's okay if you can't, that's why we need a debugger. Let's try to debug it together by applying technique from the previous chapter "Debugging by using output to console":

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=on}
```ruby
def random_pow
  pow(rand(1..10))
end

def pow(x)
  puts "Pow parameter: #{x}"
  x ^ 2
end

puts random_pow
```

We added line 6, and it is supposed to print the value we pass in into "`pow`" method. Here is the result of a sample run:

```
Pow parameter: 3
1
```

Hm... Very strange. Input parameter is 3. The second power of 3 is 9, not 1. What's going on?

When program is simple enough, the answer is obvious. However, when program is huge, and it's not easy to reproduce the bug with just running a program (for example, when you need to go though multiple steps like registration, email confirmation, and so on), debugging the program can be a hassle and can take some time.

Programmers say we "need to set a breakpoint". When execution reaches to this certain point, the program will stop and will be ready for thorough investigation. By using some tools a programmer can try to find out what's going wrong at this exact breakpoint, what variables are, what's the parameters, how call stack looks like, and so on. In other words, there is going to be a context ready for review and manipulation, not only code and final result on the screen.

Let's see how to set a breakpoint with Pry:

{lang=ruby, line-numbers=on}
```ruby
require 'pry'

def random_pow
  pow(rand(1..10))
end

def pow(x)
  binding.pry
  x ^ 2
end

puts random_pow
```

We've set a breakpoint by adding two lines (1 and 8). First line requires gem "pry" to be included. For performance reasons installed gems aren't included in Ruby programs by default. so we need "`require ...`" statement. From Ruby's standpoint Gem is just a side code written by some enthusiast. So when we say "`gem install ...`", we download gems from Internet. And when we say "`require...`", we include already downloaded gem from some default place in our local filesystem.

Highly likely that you'll deal with Ruby on Rails (RoR) framework in the future, and it has "`Gemfile`" support by default. You just need to add your gem names to this file, and if it's done correctly, RoR will load these gems automatically. 

Line 8 in the listing above has "`binding.pry`" statement. It's a special syntax indicating breakpoint: "stop the program at exactly this point and show debugger prompt".

Note that before we were running Pry from the command line, but now we need to execute the program as we normally do:

```shell
$ ruby app.rb
```

Program started, Ruby found method definitions on lines 3 and 7 and the last line is the actual entry point which is "`puts random_pow`" (or "`puts(random_pow)`", or "`puts(random_pow())`" - as you already know, parenthesis are optional). In other words, we want to put a string on the screen, and it should be result of "`random_pow`" method, so Ruby starts with executing "`random_pow`" first.

"`random_pow`" generates random number and calls "`pow`" where our breakpoint is:

```
$ ruby app.rb

From: /Users/ro/work/book/app.rb @ line 8 Object#pow:

     7: def pow(x)
 =>  8:   binding.pry
     9:   x ^ 2
    10: end

[1] pry(main)>
```

Arrow on the left shows where you are. You can type "`whereami`" Pry command to bring this screen back if you mixed up somehow and the listing has disappeared.

So now, instead of empty Pry state we had by running "`pry`" from the terminal, we are inside of a running program! We have the state of the interrupted program, with all its memory, initialized variables, parameters, and so on. So exciting, it's like debugging a Robot and investigating what's on its mind! Here is what we can do:

* See variables values (variable "`x`" in our case)
* We can change variable values
* We can call any method one or more times
* We can paste some code from the clipboard and see how it works
* We can execute the next line and go step by step gradually changing the state of a program

Some useful Pry commands are: 

* "`next`" executes the next statement (next line). After that you can read (and write) variables again.
* "`exit`" to continue execution of a program. This command tells Pry to exit back to the program. The better name for this command would be "continue".
* "`exit!`" - hard exit, stop execution right now and go back to the terminal.
* "`whereami`" - where am I? Shows the debugger prompt with arrow pointing to the current line.

These are essential commands, and there is more (type "`help`" to see the list, but you probably won't need them for this chapter).

So, how do we find the bug we were talking about? Let's print "`x`" variable and then type in "`x ^ 2`" and see what happens:

```
[2] pry(main)> whereami

From: /Users/ro/work/book/app.rb @ line 8 Object#pow:

     7: def pow(x)
 =>  8:   binding.pry
     9:   x ^ 2
    10: end

[3] pry(main)> x
2
[4] pry(main)> x ^ 2
0
```

That's rather interesting! We found that "`x`" equals to 2, and result of "`x ^ 2`" is zero. It is not something we expected. We expect to see 4, not zero. So we were able to identify the problem line. And there was no need to run the program multiple times.

Statement "`x ^ 2`" is syntactically correct, but in Ruby language it won't raise the number to the second power. "`^`" operator is used to perform "exclusive-or". But in some other programming languages it is "raise to the Nth power" operator, but in Ruby one should use "`**`" for that. Here is correct version of the program:

```ruby
def random_pow
  pow(rand(1..10))
end

def pow(x)
  x ** 2 # THIS LINE HAS BEEN FIXED 
end

puts random_pow
```

We're familiar with Pry basics now. From now on, if you face a bug, you know what to do: set a breakpoint and go step by step examining your variables.

To conclude, there is another useful, but not very well known command: "`system('reset')`". It's not a Pry command: "`system`" is reserved Ruby method that runs a system command. And "`reset`" is command to reset your terminal settings to default (not to reset your computer). Typing "`system('ls')`" resulting in printing the list of files in current directory, and "`system('pwd')`" prints working directory (p.w.d.).

Running "`man reset`" in your terminal (manual for "`reset`" command) says "initialize a terminal..."

But why do we need it and why one would want to call "`reset`" from Pry? If you're working on small programs you will probably never need it. However, large Rails applications have multiple gems which can inadvertently pollute your terminal and change its settings (for example, when you type, but don't see yourself typing). Use "`system('reset')`" to bring back default terminal settings without restarting the terminal. You can also do it by omitting "`system`" and wrapping actual command in backticks:

```
[1] pry(main)> `reset`

(screen cleared)

""
[2] pry(main)> whereami
...
```
