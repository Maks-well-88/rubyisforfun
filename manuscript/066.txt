## Comparison of hashes and arrays

### Initialization 

Array: `arr = []`

Hash: `hh = {}`

### Iteration

Array:

```ruby
arr.each do |element|
  # ...
end
```

Hash:

```ruby
hh.each do |key, value|
  # ...
end
```

or

```ruby
hh.each_key do |key|
  # ...
end
```

### Data representation

Array, sequential collection of elements: 

![Array](images/066-array.png)

Hash, data stored in an associative manner:

![Hash](images/066-hash.png)

### Access

Array, by index:

* `arr[0]`
* `arr[1]`
* `arr[2]`, etc. 

Hash, by key where the key is an object of any type:

* `hh[key]`
* `hh['cat']`
* `hh[31337]`, etc.

### Purpose

Array: represent elements in sequential order.

Hash: keeps data in an associative manner with the fast access by a key. Can be used to keep configuration settings, options, parameters.

### Class

Arrays: represented by _Array_ class.

Hashes: represented by _Hash_ class.
