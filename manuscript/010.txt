## Hello, I'm your REPL

With the case of `1 + 1` program from previous chapter, interpreter performs two actions: read (R) and evaluate (E). We had no "print" action (`puts` in our case), so there was no any result on the screen. In other words, to see results we need to perform three actions:

* Read (R)
* Evaluate (E)
* Print (P)

It would be also nice if we could avoid running `ruby` command from the terminal every time, so we can execute programs in constant loop (L).
